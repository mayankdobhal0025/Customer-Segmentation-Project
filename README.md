# Customer Segmentation Project
## Overview
This project is part of my internship at Codespaze, where we analyze customer data to identify distinct segments for better-targeted strategies. Using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and clustering techniques, we aim to group customers based on their behaviors.

## Project Structure
- Data: Contains the raw and cleaned customer datasets used for the project.
- Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks with code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model implementation.
- Reports: Final visualizations and summaries of the customer segments.
## Key Tasks
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

  - Handled missing values and outliers.
  - Normalized/standardized data for better model performance.
- Feature Engineering:

  - Created new features to enrich the dataset.
  - Extracted key behavioral insights from the raw data.
- Clustering Models:

  - Applied k-means clustering to segment customers.
  - Evaluated model performance and optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette scores.
- Visualization & Insights:

  - Visualized customer segments using matplotlib and seaborn.
  - Provided actionable insights for personalized marketing strategies.
## Installation & Usage
- Clone the repository:

  - `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation-project.git`
  - `cd customer-segmentation-project`
- Install the required packages:
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Open the Jupyter notebooks:
  - `jupyter notebook`
## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
## Results
The final customer segments were visualized and analyzed to understand their key characteristics, providing valuable insights for future marketing strategies.

## Future Work
- Testing more advanced segmentation algorithms such as DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering.
- Applying segmentation techniques to larger datasets for more granular insights.
